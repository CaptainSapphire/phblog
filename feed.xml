<p><strong>First</strong>, ensure your device is plugged in to your computer. There should be a little light that comes on when you plug it in. <br /><br /> 
<strong>Second</strong>, create the location you want to copy the CD/DVD onto on your device. If you do not know where to put it, continue reading this section.<br /><br /> 
Click on “Downloads.” Right Click and press “Create Folder.” For now, title it “DVD Downloads” followed by today’s date. Rename at your peer/boss’s instruction. 
To rename, simply right click on a file, and press “rename.”
<br /><br /> 
<strong>Third</strong>, press the button on your external ODD &amp; HDD device. The tray should then pop outwards. <br /><br /> 
Follow that by placing your CD/DVD into the tray, with the design of the object facing upwards, and the holographic side facing down. <br /><br /> 
<strong>THIS IS IMPORTANT!</strong>: Ensure your CD/DVD is clicked into the middle bit of the tray. If you close it and the device starts beeping at you, you did it wrong.<br /><br />
<strong>Fourth</strong>, navigate back to your device. If you go to the area below your pins, under “This PC” and whatnot of the side navigation, you should see a CD icon appear.
That is where your data is being put! <br /><br /> 
Now go brew some coffee, take a minute to let your information upload to the system. <br /><br /> 
Once it is done, the external device’s fan should turn off, and the light will turn off (though it might not stay off forever given power is running to it). <br /><br /></p>

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
